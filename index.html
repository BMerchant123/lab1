  <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>Hi my name is Bilal Merchant. I am from Naperville, Illinois and graduated high school at Waubonsie Valley High School. 
  I am currently in my second year at IIT and I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Applied Cybersecurity and Information Technology. 
  I currently don't have any work experience however, I will be working as intern starting in January so that not only will I gain work experience but also learn new things about cybersecurity that I have yet to learn.
  In my free time I like to play video games such as Pokemon and Super Smash Bros. </p>
